# Project Title - Find your Pet

The purpose of our project is to develop and provide a service where pet shelters can create profiles for their pets and have people be able to look and adopt. When a shelter would like to create a profile for their pet they would sign in to fill out the needed information. They would include information about the animal for example type, breed, age, color, name, small bio about how they are and a few images to show off their pet. For someone looking for a pet when creating an account, they will have to go through some user verification and provide basic information. For example name, email, phone number, type of pet looking for and the area they would like to look in. Once done the web app will suggest animals based on what the person is looking for and once they find a pet they are interested in the app will provide contact information for the shelter. In general, our project will provide an easy way to meet pets and enjoy having a new companion.
